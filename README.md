# Steps:
1. Took this amazon webpage : url = 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/aw/d/B0C3HD9KX5/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_plhdr=t&aaxitk=33548c3715d3e04419b8a09135cd03ce&hsa_cr_id=0&qid=1697952223&sr=1-1-e0fa1fdd-d857-4087-adda-5bd576b25987&ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_mcd_asin_0_img&pd_rd_w=crFFI&content-id=amzn1.sym.df9fe057-524b-4172-ac34-9a1b3c4e647d%3Aamzn1.sym.df9fe057-524b-4172-ac34-9a1b3c4e647d&pf_rd_p=df9fe057-524b-4172-ac34-9a1b3c4e647d&pf_rd_r=4H8SV1PA0Y2M3S6C06KM&pd_rd_wg=VcBMI&pd_rd_r=768acc1f-30d3-489b-9bbe-f9e11017e0d0'
2. inspected the webpage to see the html code
3. Imported productTitle, price and rating attributes of the product page and also current date from datetime library to a csv file.
4. Created a price check function which apends productTitle, price, rating, date to the csv file for every 24hrs
5. We can keep this function running in the background of the system and view the prices whenever we want.
6. We can also add a condition in the price check function where if the price drops to certain amount we can get a mail about the price details and we can buy the product as per our budget.
7. We can add that mail part using smtp library
